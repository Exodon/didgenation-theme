		<h2>About DidgeNation</h2>
		<h3>The Beginnings</h3>
		<p>When we started DidgeNation there was one obvious question: why another didgeridoo network with players’ database? There
		are so many of this kind of sites on web already, especially now that the social media has boomed. All these places took
		a lot of energy to construct, their databases now already full of players, festivals, teachers, places. Yes, indeed. But
		from some point of view, they are actually full of ghosts. Some of these places are very seldom visited. Others are
		mostly visited for self-promotion. But how many places do you know that you come to grow?</p>

		<h3></h3>The Growth!</h3>
		<p>This was the strongest underlying idea of DidgeNation. A place to grow your skills, knowledge, experience, openmidedness
		and through that process to establish deeper connections to inner as well as outer didgeridoo world. By finding a common
		interest, which we already have- didgeridoo (yidaki, wooden tube, whatever you call it), and sharing information rather
		then promotion as main approach – we feel that together we can go where we couldn’t have gone before. From this state we
		feel that our connections will be stronger than in the past, as they will have a meaningful background. They will not
		just be a mouse click that you did because you got a request and that is the way it is done. We feel that we can create
		a coherent and powerful community of all of us willing to share. A community that can support us, guide us, help us
		grow.</p>

		<h3>The articles that change your didgeridoo world!</h3>
		<p>Those wise among you can already see that this incarnation of didgeridoo portal is also inspired by a didgeridoo
		magazine that was alive a bit more than ten years ago. This time we hope to gather our friends, best didgeridoo players
		of the world, but also some less famous but nevertheless with fantastic insights. We will challenge them to write
		articles on a regular basis from which we can all learn. Things we always wanted to know. Things we didn’t even know we
		wanted to know. We hope to gather didgeridoo makers, healers, explorers, teachers, yoga and tantra practitioners,
		travelers through time and space, to share what we would all consider very valuable. We hope to sum up high quality
		content that will always want us to open DidgeNation and find out what is new.</p>

		<h3>The DidgeNation</h3>
		<p>With this in mind we kindly ask you to participate. In no other way, then just by opening DidgeNation and learning about
		this very fine art of taking breath and making sound.</p>
