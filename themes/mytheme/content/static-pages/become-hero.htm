	<h1 class="title">So you want to become a hero ?</h1>

	<h2 class="subtitle">You are in the right place…</h2>

	<p>This project is run by volunteers. Basically we just want a better didgeridoo place, so in order to help us with
		the <strong>DidgeNation</strong> project we have some basic tasks that you can help us :</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Make a heroic act of writing an article for us! If you are a knowledgeable didgeridoo player, maker,
			teacher, healer, listener or magician you can contribute with writing high quality content for DidgeNation !
		</li>
		<li>Make a heroic act as our web developers did! Join the team that holds the flesh and bones of this website!
		</li>
		<li>Join the pack of heroes by providing us photos that are didgeridoo related! If you are a photographer that
			goes to events and roams around didgeridoo kingdom, you can definitely contribute in a great way!</li>
		<li>Become a hero by collecting news from around didgeridoo world and publishing it on this website!</li>
		<li>Save the world by promoting this website through your newsletter, facebook, twitter account, or even yelling
			through your window to a crowded street…</li>
		<li>Everything from the above.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In case you find courage in your heart to be a hero, know that with just minimum of your time you can already
		help! We depend on many contributors doing many small tasks. Contact our staff without fear and share what you
		can do to make the (didgeridoo) world a better place!</p>
