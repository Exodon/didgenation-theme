	<h1 class="title">About DidgeNation</h1>

	<h2 class="subtitle">The Beginnings</h2>

	<p>When we started DidgeNation there was one obvious question: why another didgeridoo network with players’
		database? There are so many of this kind of sites on web already, especially now that the social media has
		boomed. All these places took a lot of energy to construct, their databases now already full of players,
		festivals, teachers, places. Yes, indeed. But from some point of view, they are actually full of ghosts. Some of
		these places are very seldom visited. Others are mostly visited for self-promotion. But how many places do you
		know that you come to grow?</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">The Growth!</h2>

	<p>This was the strongest underlying idea of DidgeNation. A place to grow your skills, knowledge, experience,
		openmidedness and through that process to establish deeper connections to inner as well as outer didgeridoo
		world. By finding a common interest, which we already have- didgeridoo (yidaki, wooden tube, whatever you call
		it), and sharing information rather then promotion as main approach – we feel that together we can go where we
		couldn’t have gone before. From this state we feel that our connections will be stronger than in the past, as
		they will have a meaningful background. They will not just be a mouse click that you did because you got a
		request and that is the way it is done. We feel that we can create a coherent and powerful community of all of
		us willing to share. A community that can support us, guide us, help us grow.</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">The articles that change your didgeridoo world!</h2>

	<p>Those wise among you can already see that this incarnation of didgeridoo portal is also inspired by a didgeridoo
		magazine that was alive a bit more than ten years ago. This time we hope to gather our friends, best didgeridoo
		players of the world, but also some less famous but nevertheless with fantastic insights. We will challenge them
		to write articles on a regular basis from which we can all learn. Things we always wanted to know. Things we
		didn’t even know we wanted to know. We hope to gather didgeridoo makers, healers, explorers, teachers, yoga and
		tantra practitioners, travelers through time and space, to share what we would all consider very valuable. We
		hope to sum up high quality content that will always want us to open DidgeNation and find out what is new.</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">The DidgeNation</h2>

	<p>With this in mind we kindly ask you to participate. In no other way, then just by opening DidgeNation and
		learning about this very fine art of taking breath and making sound.</p>

	<p>Your DidgeNation Team</p>
