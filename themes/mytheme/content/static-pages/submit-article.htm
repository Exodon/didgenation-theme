<h1 class="title">Guidelines for DidgeNation article contributors</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Please read carefully at least once (a week)</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Choose your strongest field in didgeridoo, and extract the most valuable points. Do not save them for later, use them for your article(s) now!</li>
	<li>If you are unsure about something, check it with someone from DidgeNation who has experience about the matter!</li>
	<li>Write in paragraphs and if possible make a title for each paragraph.</li>
	<li>Do not write very long sentences.</li>
	<li>If you write a very long article, sum up the points in the beginning under “Here’s what you need to know:” title. Example : https://www.t-nation.com/training/the-best-exercises-period – just observe the format of the first page.</li>
	<li>Some articles can be also very short, based around one specific point.</li>
	<li>Think of intriguing way to name your topics, but do not overdo the spectacle. The latter is especially true if the content doesn’t follow the greatness. Example: An article titled “Three exercises you MUST do to become a professional didgeridoo player” and in the content showing three basic exercises for circular breathing.</li>
	<li>Be careful with using of superlatives. Always question “best”, “perfect”, “epic”, “most powerful” etc.</li>
	<li>Be careful with using of commonly (over)used words like “rich in harmonics”, “concert class” etc.</li>
	<li>Be careful when you mention traditional Aboriginal ways to be respectful.</li>
	<li>Actually be respectful of everyone, without exception.</li>
	<li>Be clear if you present a) facts- name source b) your opinion c) your observation d) something else….</li>
	<li>Try to offer photos together with the article. If not possible, try to suggest what kind of photos you want to be added to your article.</li>
	<li>Try to categorize your article in terms of DidgeNation tags. This also includes difficulty level for reading. If in doubt, ask someone from DidgeNation you trust for advice!</li>
	<li>Try to see if you are doing self promotion in your article. If you do it, do it consciously and with good taste.</li>
	<li>Humour in article is more than fine, but try not to overdo it, unless you have the best day ever.</li>
	<li>Do not try to bend the didge, instead realize, there is no didge!</li>
</ol>
